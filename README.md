# MSFS POI Tracker

This is a utility to track what MSFS default POIS have and have not been visited.

It will display the nearest configurable number of POIs, announce when a POI has been visited.

Data Sources:

[MSFS BGL Files via MSFSBGLXML](https://www.fsdeveloper.com/forum/threads/msfsbglxml-convert-msfs-2020-bgl-files-to-xml.450677/). This tool is not maintained and may break in the future.

POI database is populated from [Little Navmap - MSFS POI database](https://flightsim.to/file/17193/little-navmap-msfs-poi-database).

[Processed KML file from AquilaSimX](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1KUg5jwyT_9k2A9n5IZ99UChlhfVUfO5S&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C34.777393240969104&z=1). Note this is the data source for the Little Navmap CSV above, but I process both and let the scripts remove the duplicates.

As I do not own these data sources, my source files are not included in this repository.
